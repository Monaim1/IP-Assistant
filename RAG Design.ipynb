According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a vehicle imaging apparatus comprising: a location determining module for determining the relative location of a remote imaging apparatus, the location determining module being configured to receive a tracking signal from a remote transmitter associated with the remote imaging apparatus; an image receiver module for receiving image data transmitted by the remote imaging apparatus; and at least one image processor for processing the image data in dependence on the determined location of the remote imaging apparatus. The location determining module may determine a lateral location and/or vertical location of the remote imaging apparatus. The image processor may modify the image data based on the determined location of the remote imaging apparatus. The image processor can apply corrections to the image data, for example to correct for an offset in the relative location of the remote imaging apparatus. The location determining module determines the location of the remote imaging apparatus relative to the vehicle imaging apparatus. The remote transmitter may be integrated into the remote imaging apparatus. Alternatively, the remote transmitter may be a separate device which may be disposed proximal to the remote imaging apparatus. The remote transmitter may, for example, be incorporated into an electronic key (such as a key fob) associated with the vehicle. The electronic key may be used to control locking/unlocking of the vehicle and/or activating the vehicle ignition. The electronic key may be temporarily mounted to the remote imaging apparatus, for example located in a chamber or a slot formed therein.
