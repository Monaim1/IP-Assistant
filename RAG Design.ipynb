    "\n",
    "The IP Assistant is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for intellectual property (patent) documents. It ingests patent data, chunks text content, generates embeddings using sentence transformers, and stores everything in a Milvus vector database for semantic search and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Docker Services\n",
    "\n",
    "The system runs three Docker containers an isolated containerized environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- **etcd**: Distributed key-value store for Milvus metadata\n",
    "- **minio**: Object storage for Milvus data persistence\n",
    "- **milvus-standalone**: Vector database for embeddings and metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. IP Assistant Data Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Loading\n",
    "- Loads patent data from JSON files in RawData/2018/\n",
    "- Filters to essential fields defined in RELEVANT_FIELDS\n",
    "- Processes metadata and text content\n",
    "2. Text Processing\n",
    "- Chunking: Splits text into 256-token chunks with 50-token overlap\n",
    "- Fields Processed: Title, abstract, and summary\n",
    "- Handles special characters and formatting\n",
    "3. Embedding Generation\n",
    "- Uses sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model\n",
    "- Generates 384-dimensional vectors\n",
    "- Normalizes embeddings for cosine similarity\n",
    "4. Milvus Storage\n",
    "- Collection: ip_chunks\n",
    "\n",
    " - Metadata: Publication/patent numbers, dates, classifications\n",
    " - Content: Text chunks and embeddings\n",
    "-Indexing: HNSW for vector search, secondary indexes for filtering"
